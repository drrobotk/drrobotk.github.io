I am a Data Scientist with an MSci in Mathematics, with First Class Honours, and a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and as such I have a lot of analytical experience including theoretical and applied techniques in mathematics, statistical and numerical methods. I am an expert on coding in Python and creating reproducible data pipelines (ETL, RAP) and deploying machine learning models at scale, using cloud services (e.g GCP, Cloudera) and technologies such as Apache Spark or BigQuery with SQL.

I have experience coding in many languages (e.g Python, C++) using various OS and I have extensively used computational software (e.g Matlab, Mathematica, Maple) or libraries (e.g numpy, scipy, scikit-learn) for performing mathematical, physical, and statistical computations on various analyses and datasets. For my PhD research, I had performed extensive computations on multi-dimensional arrays. I also have experience teaching and tutoring Mathematics and Physics at a Graduate (BSc/MSc), A-level and GCSE. I am currently tutoring university students in mathematics topics such as advanced statistics, linear algebra and Python coding.

I am also familiar with data science and machine learning R and Python libraries (e.g Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) as well as data visualization tools such as Tableau. As a freelance data scientist, I analysed instantaneous power consumption data of a large number of households with ML to identify various devices (e.g the TV or kettle) and classify when they are turned on and the occurrences/duration of their usage, to identify routines and detection of anomalies. This data was provided by a particular company that aims to use ML and modelling with domestic electric appliances.

In June 2021, I was employed as a Data Scientist at the Higher Executive Officer grade at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) within the Economics Statistics Group (ESG), where I was researching and implementing multilateral price indices, using calculations and time series extension methods in Python. This work was as part of an ETL Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) on Cloudera with Apache Spark for the treatment of [alternative data sources](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/introducingalternativedataintoconsumerpricestatisticsaggregationandweights/2021-11-09) (scanner and web-scraped data) and [new index methods](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/newindexnumbermethodsinconsumerpricestatistics/2020-09-01) (e.g multilateral methods) which will be used to determine the consumer price index (CPI) in the future. 

While working on building a data pipeline for the CPI, I made very significant contributions both to methodology and computational efficiency, e.g I led an investigation into particular model-based multilateral index methods known as the Time Product Dummy (TPD), Time Dummy Hedonic (TDH) using an application of weighted least squares regression. I developed an efficient application of these methods and more for the integration of alternative data sources.

In March 2022, I joined the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/) at the ONS with a promotion to Senior Executive Officer. My first project was on the [least cost index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/trackingthelowestcostgroceryitemsukexperimentalanalysis/april2021toapril2022), where I played a significant role in researching and implementing the price index and aggregation methods. This was used to track the price over time of the lowest-cost grocery items for 30 products over multiple retailers using web-scraped data and a data pipeline on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
