# Introduction

My name is **Usman Kayani** and I am a [neurodivergent](https://exceptionalindividuals.com/neurodiversity/) Data Scientist with an extensive background in mathematics (MSci, PhD), and as such I have a lot of analytical experience including theoretical and applied techniques in mathematics, statistics and numerical methods. 

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/tp.jpeg" alt="isolated" width="350"/></p>

I am an expert in Python code development, creating analytical data pipelines (ETL, RAP) and deploying machine learning models at scale, using cloud services (e.g GCP, Cloudera) and technologies such as Apache Spark or BigQuery with SQL.

<p align="center"><img src="https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ETL-Process.jpg" alt="isolated" width="350"/></p>

I am also neurodivergent with [ADHD](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/) and [Dyslexia](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia), and this has shaped my life and career in many ways. I am passionate about diversity and inclusion, and I am a strong advocate for neurodiversity in the [workplace](https://www.inclusiveemployers.co.uk/blog/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace-understanding-is-key/). I am also a strong believer in the power of data and technology to improve people's lives, and I am always looking for ways to use my skills to make a positive impact on society.

# Academia and Research

I completed an MSci in Mathematics, with **First Class Honours**, and a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/). 

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/"><img src="/assets/img/kcl.jpeg" alt="isolated" width="175"/></a></p>

During my MSci, I scored highly in my mathematics modules, most notably gaining 99% in Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations with Complex Variables. In my second year as an undergraduate, I had written a paper under the advice of one of my professors, who thought that it was interesting enough to be posted on the [university website](https://web.archive.org/web/20100113041557/http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk:80/courses/cm211.html) for the mathematics department. This gave me valuable experience on how to write a paper and investigate different mathematical techniques and ideas.

The paper I wrote was on a new method to solve linear ordinary differential equations of any order with non-constant coefficients and certain classes of partial differential equations. As a result, by the recommendation of another professor and based on my academic record, I was able to attend the fourth year module, Fourier Analysis, for extra credit in my second year.

For my MSci dissertation, I studied integrable quantum spin chains. This introduced me to quantum interaction models particularly the Heisenberg spin chain, which describes the nearest neighbour interaction of particles with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$  (i.e electrons) and naturally arises in the study of ferromagnetism. 

<p align="center">

</p>

These models have acquired growing importance in [quantum computing](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.09994) within the field of quantum information processing, mainly as a means of efficiently transferring information. In addition to the understanding of quantum computing that I acquired from the research, it also gave me insights into various mathematical methods to diagonalize large square matrices which can grow exponentially according to the number of particles.

<img src="/assets/img/qubit.gif" alt="isolated" width="300"/>
</p>

For my academic excellence in my MSci, I was also awarded a scholarship by the [Science and Technology Facilities Council](https://stfc.ukri.org/) (STFC) to undertake a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics under the mathematics department. The main theme of my [PhD research](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1910.01080) was a study of the symmetries of black hole horizons in quantum gravity. 

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/qg.jpg" alt="isolated" width="425"/>
<img src="/assets/img/source.gif" alt="isolated" width="300"/>
</p>

In particular, I studied black holes under various [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and [supergravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergravity) theories, specifically [type IIA](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06(2015)139), [massive type IIA](https://doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/32/23/235004) and [5-dimensional](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/aac30c) supergravities (both gauged and ungauged). The work has been published in three peer-review papers in leading international journals with the third publication on the five-dimensional supergravity theories being a sole-author paper. My examiners remarked at the great achievement to produce such a sole-author paper during a PhD. I had also continued my research and publications in quantum gravity as an independent researcher for black holes in [6-dimensional](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1912.04249) gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravity.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/stringt.png" alt="isolated" width="400"/></p>

For my research in quantum gravity, I also performed extensive computations on multi-dimensional arrays for supergravity calculations using Python with [Cadabra](https://cadabra.science/), particularly for clifford algebras and spinors in higher dimensions.

<p align="center"><a href="https://cadabra.science/"><img src="/assets/img/cadabra.jpg" alt="isolated" width="350"/></a></p>

I also attended various academic seminars and conferences such as the [Winter School on Supergravity, Strings, and Gauge Theory](https://indico.cern.ch/event/439879/) at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/) in Switzerland, and I presented my research at many conferences including the [Young Theoristsâ€™ Forum](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/YTF/8/) at Durham University.

# Tutoring and Content Development

I have experience teaching and tutoring Mathematics, Physics and Programming at a Graduate (BSc/MSc), A-level and GCSE. I was a graduate teaching assistant at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) for 6 years, and a private tutor for over 12 years. During my PhD, I also volunteered for roles in science communication, such as with the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/), to explain my research on black holes to school children.

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.iop.org/"><img src="/assets/img/iop.png" alt="isolated" width="175"/></a></p>

In the last few years, I have also undertaken freelance work with [Witherow Brooke](https://www.witherowbrooke.co.uk/), a private tuition and educational consultancy company which was featured in The Telegraph. I am currently tutoring university students in mathematics topics such as advanced statistics, linear algebra and Python coding.

I also worked as a freelance mathematics content writer and video developer for [Nagwa](https://www.nagwa.com/en/), a leading educational technology company in the Middle East and North Africa. I was responsible for developing educational videos and content for the company's online platform for topics in mathematics from GCSE to graduate level, such as algebra, trigonometry, calculus and statistics.

# Coding and Data Science

I have extensive experience coding in many high-level programming languages (e.g C++, Java), scripting languages (e.g Python, R, Bash, etc) and symbolic languages (e.g Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple etc) using various operating systems (e.g Linux, Windows, Mac OS). 

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"><img src="/assets/img/wolfram.gif" alt="isolated" width="600"/></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/R.gif" alt="isolated" width="300"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/assets/img/python-shm.gif" alt="isolated" width="350"/></p>

In addition to [Cadabra](https://cadabra.science/), I used [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) for my research in quantum gravity during my PhD and beyond. I have also used various programming languages or libraries (e.g NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib etc) to perform mathematical, physical, and statistical computations for various analyses and datasets. 

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/pylib.png" alt="isolated" width="350"/></p>

After leaving academia, one of the roles I decided to pursue was a Scientific Software Engineer at the Meteorological Office. For this role, I gave a presentation on the history, applications and good practices in scientific software engineering.

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/"><img src="/assets/img/mo.png" alt="isolated" width="125"/></a></p>

Ultimately I decided to embark on a career in data science instead. Nevertheless, the panel was very impressed with my application and noted that I had a good understanding of the importance of software quality, and awareness of the challenges of developing scientific software. I also demonstrated good examples of software development, especially in Python and a sensible approach to debugging code, including when working with otherâ€™s code. 

I am experienced with data science and machine learning Python libraries (e.g Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) as well as data visualization software such as Tableau and Power BI.

</p>

As a freelance data scientist, I analysed instantaneous power consumption data of a large number of households with supervised machine learning models to identify various devices (e.g the TV or kettle) and classify when they are turned on and the occurrences/duration of their usage, to identify routines and detection of anomalies. This data was provided by a particular company that aims to use ML and modelling with domestic electric appliances.

# My journey at the Office for National Statistics
### Data Scientist in `Reproducible Data Science and Analysis`

In **June 2021**, I was employed as a Data Scientist at the *Higher Executive Officer* grade at the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) within the Economics Statistics Group (ESG) and the Reproducible Data Science and Analysis (RDSA) team, formerly known as Emerging Platforms Delivery Support (EPDS). 

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/"><img src="/assets/img/ons.png" alt="isolated" width="275"/></a></p>

After only my second month at the ONS, I was a member of the induction team responsible for onboarding new starters and aiding or mentoring to new members of the team. My main work was researching and implementing [multilateral](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IndexNumR/vignettes/indexnumr.html#multilateral-index-numbers) price indices, using calculations and time series extension methods in Python. This work was as part of an ETL Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) on Cloudera with Apache Spark for the treatment of [alternative data sources](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/introducingalternativedataintoconsumerpricestatisticsaggregationandweights/2021-11-09) (scanner and web-scraped data) and [new index methods](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/newindexnumbermethodsinconsumerpricestatistics/2020-09-01) which will be used to determine the consumer price index (CPI) in the future. 

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/spark.png" alt="isolated" width="400"/></p>

As part of the [new index methods](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/newindexnumbermethodsinconsumerpricestatistics/2020-09-01), I had been looking at mutlilateral methods which simultaneously make use of all data over a given time period. Their use for calculating temporal price indices is relatively new internationally, but these methods have been shown to have some desirable properties relative to their [bilateral](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IndexNumR/vignettes/indexnumr.html#bilateral-index-numbers) method counterparts, in that they account for new and disappearing products (to remain representative of the market) while also reducing the scale of chain-drift.

While working on building a data pipeline for the CPI, I made very significant contributions both to methodology and computational efficiency for the integration of alternative data sources. In my first few months, I led an investigation into a particular implicit hedonic multilateral index method known as the [Time Product Dummy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/roiw.12468#roiw12468-sec-0002-title) (TPD) method, which uses a log-linear price model with weighted least squares regression and expenditure shares as weights.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln p_i^{t} &= \alpha + \sum_{r=1}^T \delta^r D_i^{t,r} + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\gamma_j K_{i,j} + \epsilon_i^{t} \ , \\
s_i^{t} &= \frac{p_i^t q_i^t}{\sum_{j=1}^N p_j^t q_j^t}  \ .
\end{aligned}
$$

After noticing an error in the formulae and example workbooks produced for these methods and bringing this to the attention of the ONS, I worked closely with people from methodology on making sure we got all the technical details right.

My first task was to implement the TPD method within the CPI pipeline using PySpark. Spark's native ML library though powerful generally lacks many features, and is not suited for modelling on multiple groups or subsets of the data at once. The usual approach to use custom functions or transformations which are not part of the built-in functions provided by Sparkâ€™s standard library is to use a User Defined Function (UDF). However, the downside of this is they have performance issues, since they executed row-at-a-time and thus suffer from high serialization and invocation overhead.

<p align="center"><img src="https://noufel1393.gitlab.io/noufel1393/img/blog_images/pyspark_udf_large.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/></p>

This led me toward discovering [Pandas UDFs](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/05/20/new-pandas-udfs-and-python-type-hints-in-the-upcoming-release-of-apache-spark-3-0.html), which allow for vectorized operations on Big Data and increase performance by up to 100x compared to regular UDFs, and have since been implemented in various multilateral index methods and an integral part of the CPI pipeline. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://kontext.tech/api/flex/medias/obj-1563" alt="isolated" width="500"/></p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html"><img src="https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-4.png" alt="isolated" width="500"/></a></p>

I also used the same ideas for the [Time Dummy Hedonic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/roiw.12468#roiw12468-sec-0002-title) (TDH) method, which is an explicit hedonic model similar to TPD, but also uses the item characteristics in the WLS regression model. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln p_i^{t} = \delta^0 + \sum_{r=1}^T \delta^r D_i^{t,r} + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k z_{i,k} + \epsilon_i^{t} \ . 
\end{aligned}
$$

After implementing the TPD and TDH methods, I turned my attention to another multilateral method known as [Geary-Khamis](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/a-comparison-of-ten-methods-for-multilateral-international-price-and-volume-comparison.pdf) (GK) and the usual method involves iteratively calculating the set of quality adjustment factors simultaneously with the price levels. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
b_{n}&=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\left[\frac{q_{t n}}{q_{n}}\right]\left[\frac{p_{t n}}{P_{t}}\right] \ ,
\nonumber \\
P_{t}&=\frac{p^{t} \cdot q^{t}}{ \vec{b} \cdot q^{t}} \ .
\end{aligned}
$$


I was able to independently research and implement a method solely based on [matrix operations](https://drrobotk.github.io/2021-09-20-Geary-Khamis/), which makes the method more efficient since it has vectorized operations which act on the entire data. I also refactored my code for TPD and TDH using matrix operations, which turned out to be more efficient and increased performance by up to 7x compared to standard statistical libraries. The Pandas UDFs were also applied to the time series [extension methods](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/Session_1_Netherlands_Paper.pdf) for TPD, TDH, GK and another multilateral method known as [GEKS](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.22/2016/Session_1_room_doc_Netherlands_an_overview_of_price_index_methods.pdf). 

In **October 2021**, after working closely with methodology on index numbers, I was invited to join the [Index Numbers Expert Group](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/methodology/information-on-specific-methods/#index-numbers) (INEG) and the [Data Science and High-performance computing](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/methodology/information-on-specific-methods/#data-science-and-high-performance-computing) (DaSH) expert group. 

In **November 2021**, I delivered a presentation in a seminar to my team and deparment, to introduce the concept of Pandas UDFs. This turned out to be a success as I got good engagement and questions after the presentation, as well as interest from other parties in DaSH, to watch the recording and slides. I also presented a seminar aimed at people both little and extensive knowledge of the subjects, and a Jupyter Notebook of worked examples. I discussed this material with a computing specialist, and with their feedback have produced useful material with a full set of instructions and worked examples, which is accessible to a wider audience.

### Data scientist in the `Data Science Campus`

In **March 2022**, I joined the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/) at the ONS with a promotion to *Senior Executive Officer* and a permanent civil servant.

<p align="center"><a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/"><img src="/assets/img/dsc.png" alt="isolated" width="200"/></a></p>

My first project was on the [least cost index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/trackingthelowestcostgroceryitemsukexperimentalanalysis/april2021toapril2022), which was published in May 2022. I played a significant role in researching and implementing the price index and aggregation methods, which was powered by a Python price index package which I created called [PriceIndexCalc](https://pypi.org/project/PriceIndexCalc/).

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/trackingthelowestcostgroceryitemsukexperimentalanalysis/april2021toapril2022"><img src="/assets/img/lci.png" alt="isolated" width="600"/></a></p>

My package and work was used to track the prices over time of the lowest-cost grocery items for 30 products over multiple retailers, using web-scraped data and a data pipeline on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). This analysis was conducted as part of the ONS's current and future analytical work related to the cost of living.

<p align="center"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/"><img src="/assets/img/gcp.jpg" alt="isolated" width="175"/></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/bucket.png" alt="isolated" width="600"/></p>

In **April 2022**, I also joined the Data Access Platform Capability And Training Support (DAPCATS) as a mentor, where I have been helping other data scientists and analysts with their work and projects. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/ons-spark/_static/logo.png" alt="isolated" width="200"/></p>


I also took part in the *Spark at the ONS* event hosted by DAPCATS and created for the launch of a new [online book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/ons-spark/intro.html). This event was used to discuss various topics and resources related to Spark and Big Data, and I delivered a presentation titled *Spark application debugging, tuning and optimization*. For this talk, I discussed various tips and techniques to increase efficiency, identify bugs or bottlenecks that can cause Spark applications to be slow or fail, and tuning Spark parameters accordingly. This can help to reduce overall developer and compute time, costs for resources to run the Spark application or the environmental impact that comes with using unnecessary extra resources or having significantly longer runtimes. 

In **August 2022**, I received the Recognition Award for outstanding collaboration and contribution to the ONS. I provided very important support to help another team to publish the [Capital Stocks user guide](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/introducingthecapitalstocksuserguide) article and the work has made the UK the only country to introduce such transparency. The process involved sharing their [statistical production code](https://github.com/ONSdigital/Capstocks) in the ONS's GitHub account and I dedicated my time to help them set up the initial account, and to upload the packages in GitHub as the team hadn't experienced using this platform before. I also took the time to give them a very detailed walk through of how the platform works, and helped them by sharing tips and examples of good practice. My support enabled them to make their capital stocks statistical production system accessible and reproducible by all external users, helping them make the statistics more inclusive and introducing innovating platforms to help their users improve their analysis and budgetary forecasting.
