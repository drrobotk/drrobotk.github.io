My thesis was on dynamical symmetry enhancement of black hole horizons. In particular, I studied black holes in the context of quantum gravity and I was able to prove certain mathematical properties in a much more general and unified way than previous work on the subject.

In order to explain this, first let me talk about a few concepts.

Symmetry is an important concept in fundamental physics, often implemented using the mathematics of group theory and Lie algebras. A symmetry transformation is one that leaves all measurable quantities intact.

For example, the rotation of a rigid body is a symmetry transformation. If you rotate a rigid body by an angle $\theta$ about an axis, then the position of the body is unchanged.

The geometry of a black hole is encoded in the metric tensor, which captures the geometric and causal structure of space-time â€“ which is used to define notions such as time, distance, volume etc.

The symmetries of the metric tensor are captured by something called a Killing vector, the number of which tells you the amount of symmetry you have. The near-horizon geometry of a black hole is what we see when we zoom in right at the event horizon of a black hole, which usually has a more constrained geometry with more killing vectors, which is what is known as symmetry enhancement. This zooming in is called the near horizon limit.

It was shown by Stephen Hawking that the event horizon of a black hole in 4-dimensional spacetime must have spherical topology. This is no longer true in higher dimensions, where most proposed unified theories of nature or quantum gravity are defined.  This means we have to re-examine the shape for black holes in these theories as previously established results such as the uniqueness theorem no longer hold.

Supersymmetry is a concept that introduces a symmetry between bosons and fermions. Similar to symmetry, the number of supersymmetries is captured by something called a Killing spinor, and the number of Killing spinors tells you how much supersymmetry is realized for a given solution. The killing spinors also imply the field equations for any given theory, but are usually easier to solve as they are first-order differential equations while the field equations are second-order.

Although the work and computations in my research were pretty lengthy, the final results are easy to understand. We were able to show that black holes in particular supergravity theories undergo symmetry enhancement, and for these theories the number of supersymmetries are always an even number. We were also able to investigate other properties of the near-horizon geometry and eliminate certain solutions. The work was done by analysing and solving certain differential equations.
